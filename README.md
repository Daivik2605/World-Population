Analysis on World Population Data
This work presents the statistical analysis of the world population dataset using Excel and Python. This report includes statistical information, data visualization, and inference of statistical data and visualization.

This dataset has historical population data for every country and territory worldwide and various demographic and geographic parameters, including the area size, continent, capital city, population density, growth rate, population rank, and world population share. This report aims to perform a statistical analysis of global population distribution and area characteristics using Excel and Python to explore key metrics and validate findings.

The statistical analysis is done for the 2022 Population and Area.  For each of the selected columns, we compute the following:
1.	Min 
2.	Max
3.	Count
4.	Range 
5.	Interquartile Range
6.	Median
7.	Mean
8.	Mode
9.	1st and 3rd Quartiles
10.	Sample Variance
11.	Sample Standard Deviation
12.	Finding Outliers limits â€“ Lower and Upper Limit

We visualize the outliers and the relationship between the columns. We plot the following visualizations:
1.	Box Plot
2.	Standard Deviation
3.	Linear Regression
